      Our product line at GSD is developed biannually. For
      each season we establish several collections by theme, holiday, or medium. This start to finish work is a lot of fun. It is also quite humbling to get back a sample that looks nothing like your sketches and specs as you discover the things that you saw as direct and precise instructions are not always interpreted or translated the same way on the other end. Working with vendors around the world allows for such great reflection on language and how we casually speak.
