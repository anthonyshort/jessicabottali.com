  <div class="Project-content">
    Colourbeat provides a new approach on how to interpret and incorporate health and fitness. They were looking for an impression that was clean and simple, yet powerful and scalable. Naturally, I worked on several iterations to achieve this idea. Dance, music, and movement are core focuses of the company, so i wanted to incorporate those ideas into the logo. I also broadened the scope of the brand out with mockups in print and web to relay the potential for it’s usage.

      <p>
      The disco dance floor squares initially stemmed from a concept on dance steps, and mid-century illustrations for lessons. The steps themselves were too literal, and because the goal of Colourbeat is to create a movement through movement, they needed a logo that went beyond solely it’s surface appearance. Time signatures and beats were a secondary notion of the logo design and the reason for four squares. The third misaligned square, or perhaps the “coloured beat,” represents an accent, and a means of standing out amid the rest. The logo is a strong, bold collective and each individual is supported by the whole.
